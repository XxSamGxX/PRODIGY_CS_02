Python Program to implement Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption.
Pixel manipulation for image encryption involves altering the individual pixels of an image in a way that obscures the original content to prevent unauthorized access or viewing. This technique is a part of image encryption, which is the process of securing digital images by transforming them into a format that is not easily readable or viewable without proper decryption.

Hereâ€™s a basic outline of how pixel manipulation can be used for image encryption:

1. **Pixel Value Transformation**: This involves changing the pixel values in a way that makes the original image unrecognizable. Techniques can include mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, or bitwise operations. For example, each pixel's RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values can be altered using a secret key to generate a new set of values that represent the encrypted image.

2. **Key-Based Transformation**: Encryption algorithms use a key to control how the pixels are altered. Without the correct key, it is extremely difficult to reverse the process and retrieve the original image. Common methods include using symmetric encryption algorithms (where the same key is used for encryption and decryption) or asymmetric encryption (where different keys are used for encryption and decryption).

In practice, image encryption methods often combine multiple techniques to enhance security. For example, you might first shuffle pixel locations, then apply a substitution operation, and finally use a key to control the pixel value transformations. The goal is to make it extremely difficult for an unauthorized person to reconstruct the original image from the encrypted version.
